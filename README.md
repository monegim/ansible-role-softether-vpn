Ansible Role - SoftEther VPN

## How connect to SoftEther via Android(iPhone) clients
You can install `openvpn` client on the device and follow this guide:
[Softether SSL VPN client for android & iphone [Port 443]](https://www.vpnusers.com/viewtopic.php?t=2628#p5373)

1. download the OpenVPN connect from google play
2. download the profile file (with ovpn extension). The file can be generated by the VPN server.
3. edit the file and change the port to 443, but make sure the VPN server support 443 port
4. install OpenVPN connect
5. select "import" from the software menu
6. setect "importprofile from SD card"
7. locate your ovpn file location and import it to the mobile phone.

### Detail
Open the host_openvpn_remote_access_l3.ovpn file with a texteditor and change proto udp --to--> proto tcp (udp is also possible, but sometimes blocked by firewalls)
and of course:
remote domain.de 1194 --to--> remote domain.de 443 (if you havn't changed it before)

Install the offical openvpn-client to your iOS devise and import the ovpn-file (with the help of itunes or as a mail attachement).

A nice to know: SoftEther listen at all "Listiner Ports" for any compatible vpn. So you can use OpnVPN (or ssl-vpn or SSTP) @443, @1194, @5555 or any other configured port.

Btw. OpenVPN with TCP @443 looks also (compared with SSL VPN) very similar to "normal" ssl-traffic. So nearly everywhere, where https is allowed, the vpn works.
